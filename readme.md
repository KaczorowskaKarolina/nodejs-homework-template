## REST API

---

REST API for working with a set of contacts.

## Introduction

---

Postman was used to work with the REST API.

REST API supports the following routes:

- @ GET /api/contacts
- @GET /api/contacts/:id
- @POST /api/contacts
- @DELETE /api/contacts/:id
- @PUT /api/contacts/:id

For routes that accept data (POST and PUT), checking (validation) of the received data has been considered. The joi package was used for validation.

Strategy used: Single Action Controller.
